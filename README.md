# ForceFit
ForceFit a program created by a previous student at Washington State University, my contribution was removing the GUI and adding a parser to the program.  This program runs in Linux only.

DL Poly, Lammps, and Tinker are all their own stand-alone programs output are utilized for this program to run properly.  These programs were not developed by Washington State University or myself, all credit to these programs belong to their rightful owners

Beyond the above files all credit to the other calculations and underlying logic past the parser belongs to Washington State University, specifally the Chemistry Department headed by Aurora Clark.
